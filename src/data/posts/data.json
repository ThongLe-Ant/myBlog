The main choice often comes down to SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases.\n\n![Database comparison](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n\n### SQL\nRelational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL use a structured schema and are excellent for applications requiring complex queries and transactional integrity.\n\n### NoSQL\nNon-relational databases like MongoDB and Redis offer flexibility in schema design and are often better for unstructured data and horizontal scalability."

This is often the most complex step.\n3.  **Load:** The transformed data is loaded into the target data warehouse or database."

This provides data scientists and analysts with the flexibility to explore and analyze data using various tools and techniques without the constraints of a predefined schema. It's often used for machine learning and big data analytics."

It's about telling a clear and compelling story.\n\n### Key Principles:\n- **Choose the Right Chart:** Use bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, scatter plots for relationships, and pie charts for parts of a whole (use sparingly!).\n- **Keep it Simple:** Avoid clutter, unnecessary decorations, and 3D effects. Let the data speak for itself.\n- **Use Color Purposefully:** Use color to highlight key information, not to decorate. Be mindful of color blindness.\n- **Label Clearly:** Ensure your axes, titles, and legends are clear and easy to understand."
