The main choice often comes down to SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases.\n\n![Database comparison](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n\n### SQL\nRelational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL use a structured schema and are excellent for applications requiring complex queries and transactional integrity.\n\n### NoSQL\nNon-relational databases like MongoDB and Redis offer flexibility in schema design and are often better for unstructured data and horizontal scalability."
