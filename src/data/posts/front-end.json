    "content": "## Introduction to React Hooks\n\nReact Hooks have revolutionized how we write components. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Let's dive into the most essential hooks.\n\n![React Logo](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n*A visual representation of React components.*\n\n### useState\nThe `useState` hook is the most common hook and is used to add state to functional components. Here is a simple counter example:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### useEffect\nThe `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It's a close replacement for `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.\n\n### Video Tutorial\nHere's a great video explaining `useEffect` in detail:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ZJgAiU8iJs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
