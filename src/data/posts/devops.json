Containers allow you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.\n\n![Docker Logo](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n\nThis solves the \"it works on my machine\" problem.\n\n### Basic Docker Commands\n- `docker build -t my-app .` - Builds an image from a Dockerfile.\n- `docker run -p 8080:80 my-app` - Runs the container and maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host."

    "content": "## Automate Your Workflow\n\nContinuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process of software delivery. GitHub Actions allows you to create workflows defined in a YAML file directly in your repository. These workflows can be triggered by events like a push or a pull request."

It handles service discovery, load balancing, self-healing, and rolling updates across a cluster of machines, making it the industry standard for container orchestration."

    "content": "## Declarative Infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Terraform uses a declarative language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define your desired infrastructure state. It then figures out how to achieve that state, creating a plan that you can review before applying."

    "content": "## See What's Happening\n\nObservability is crucial for understanding the health of your systems. Prometheus scrapes metrics from your applications and stores them in a time-series database. Grafana then connects to Prometheus (and other data sources) to let you build rich, interactive dashboards to visualize those metrics, helping you spot trends and troubleshoot issues."

    "content": "## Don't Commit Secrets!\n\nHardcoding secrets in your code is a major security risk. Anyone with access to your source code repository will have access to your credentials. Best practices include using environment variables (managed via `.env` files for local development), and leveraging secret management services like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Google Secret Manager for production environments."
