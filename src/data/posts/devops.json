Containers allow you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.\n\n![Docker Logo](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n\nThis solves the \"it works on my machine\" problem.\n\n### Basic Docker Commands\n- `docker build -t my-app .` - Builds an image from a Dockerfile.\n- `docker run -p 8080:80 my-app` - Runs the container and maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host."
