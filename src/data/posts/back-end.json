Setting up a basic server is straightforward.\n\n![Node.js and Express Logos](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n\n### Basic Server Setup\nHere's a simple example of an Express server:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Video Guide\nCheck out this comprehensive tutorial on building a full REST API:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKd0Rpw7O48\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

By creating indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, you can dramatically reduce query times. However, indexes also have a cost, as they need to be updated on every write operation."

When a user logs in, the server creates a JWT containing user information and sends it to the client. The client then includes this token in the header of subsequent requests to access protected routes."
