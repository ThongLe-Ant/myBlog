Setting up a basic server is straightforward.\n\n![Node.js and Express Logos](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n\n### Basic Server Setup\nHere's a simple example of an Express server:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Video Guide\nCheck out this comprehensive tutorial on building a full REST API:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKd0Rpw7O48\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

    "content": "## Speed Up Your Queries\n\nDatabase indexing is crucial for application performance. By creating indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, you can dramatically reduce query times. However, indexes also have a cost, as they need to be updated on every write operation."

    "content": "## Secure Your API\n\nJWTs are a popular way to handle authentication in modern web applications. When a user logs in, the server creates a JWT containing user information and sends it to the client. The client then includes this token in the header of subsequent requests to access protected routes."

An effective caching strategy can drastically reduce latency, decrease network traffic, and lessen the load on your backend servers. We'll explore techniques like using Redis for a distributed cache and leveraging Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)."

    "content": "## Asynchronous Communication\n\nIn an event-driven architecture, services communicate asynchronously through events. A service publishes an event when something notable happens, and other services can subscribe to these events to perform their own tasks. This pattern, often implemented with message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ, leads to highly decoupled and scalable systems."
