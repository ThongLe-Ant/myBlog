Here’s a structured approach to make it more manageable.\n\n![Books and code](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n\n1.  **Start with the 'Why':** Understand the language's core use cases.\n2.  **Master the Basics:** Focus on syntax, variables, control flow, and functions.\n3.  **Build a Small Project:** Apply what you've learned to a simple, tangible project. This is the most critical step.\n4.  **Read Others' Code:** Explore open-source projects to learn idiomatic coding styles."
