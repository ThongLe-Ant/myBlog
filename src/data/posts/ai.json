They are the technology behind services like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\n\n![AI Brain](https://placehold.co/600x300.png)\n*Conceptual art of an AI brain processing information.*\n\nThey work by predicting the next word in a sequence, allowing them to write essays, answer questions, and even generate code.\n\n### How are they trained?\nThe training process involves feeding the model terabytes of text from the internet and books. The model learns patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from this data."

    "excerpt": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs by grounding them in external knowledge bases.",
    "content": "## Grounding LLMs in Facts\n\nRAG combines the power of pre-trained language models with an information retrieval component. Before generating a response, the model retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge source (like a vector database). This helps to reduce hallucinations and allows the model to answer questions about specific, private data."

    "excerpt": "Two primary methods exist for customizing LLMs: prompt engineering and fine-tuning. Understanding the difference is key to effective AI application development.",
    "content": "## Customizing LLMs\n\n**Prompt Engineering** involves crafting the perfect input (prompt) to guide the model to the desired output. It's fast and cheap but can be brittle.\n\n**Fine-Tuning** involves further training the model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. It's more powerful and robust but requires more data and compute resources."

They use algorithms like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) to perform incredibly fast and efficient similarity searches. This is the core technology that powers Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems."
