Sourcegraph indexes your code and provides features like go-to-definition, find references, and detailed search filters (e.g., `repo:^github\\.com/my-org/` `type:diff` `author:me`). It's like having an IDE for your entire organization's code."

    "content": "## Who Wrote This?\n\nThe name 'blame' is a bit misleading. It's not about blaming people for bugs. It's about finding context. When you encounter a confusing line of code, `git blame` helps you find the commit where it was introduced. From there, you can look at the commit message and the related changes to understand *why* the code was written that way. It's a tool for historical context, not for pointing fingers."
